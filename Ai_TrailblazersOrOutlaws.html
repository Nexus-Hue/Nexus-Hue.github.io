                                            AI has potential, but at what cost?
 I am going to call out a lot of issues with AI, but I still believe it has potential across most. Putting it in everything just for the hell of it is beyond dumb, but It can still bring positive change if used correctly. 
                                                                                            The problem is that we won’t get to that point if we treat AI like a banana republic. 
                                                                                            I am also going to  be talking very critically about managers and business owners who exploit workers while not actually contributing anything themselves. I know this isn't everyone and there is good leadership out there but the majority is not.
                                                
                                                
                                                                                            AI isn’t just a tool anymore.
                                                It’s quickly becoming a core part of a lot of businesses and  government.
                                                The way it’s built, trained, and used affects EVERYONE.<br><br>

Not just creators who have their work stolen. <br>
Not just investors who WILL lose a ton of money when the hype dies.<br>
EVERYONE will be affected by these changes. 
If we let them create a whole new narrative we won’t own ANYTHING.
I know this sounds like "a do0MeR tAkE" simply because it's not guaranteed but simping over some hypothetical utopia is just as stupid, realistically it's worse. Big Tech is centralizing power more every day, so nothing points towards this utopia other than CEOs fantasizing over the idea of holding all the power.
Any kind of ethical move big tech makes is AFTER backlash. SO by staying quite we are letting them change the rules and we can't be scared to call it like it is out of fear that we will be labeled "d00MeRs" <br><br>

Exploitation is masquerading as innovation.<br> 
Just look at places like India. 
The work load didn’t go down. IT WENT UP !<br>
bUt nExuS tHat hAs mOrE tO dO wItH thE sYtEm iN pLaCe nOt aI<br>
I fucken know that, but that's exactly why it needs to be said. Letting tech  bros create the narrative is going to lead to those changes in structure that makes exploitation easier.<br><br> 
People have less free time and are constantly exploited to keep doing MORE.
If you do well you are rewarded with more work while the people at the top who don't know how to do shit get all the credit.
"Make this faster! Get this done in half the time. Do this with half the budget"  
"we’re not hiring more people but we still want double the output."
Management doesn't do shit and get's a raise for exploiting workers...<br><br>

Literally, ANYONE can say:<br>
“Do this faster.”<br>
“Do it with less money.”<br><br>

That’s not leadership. That’s exploitation.<br><br>

They think they’re Steve Jobs because they read one article on “10x productivity.”<br>

Steve Jobs isn’t a a good role model for leadership.
You can’t expect to build the biggest tech company by being a FUCKEN ASSHOLE to your team. He was the exception, not the blueprint.<br><br>

You’re doing 3x the work on half the time for the same pay. 
Meanwhile, the biggest task your manager accomplished after one week of work was making a PowerPoint called “Driving Excellence Through Scalable Synergies.”  That'll definitely fix the legacy codebase that hasn’t had a proper refactor since Obama’s first term.
<br><br>


Creators who made these models possible? They’re barely getting credited, let alone compensated. 


Real progress doesn’t look like this.
Real progress respects creators, builds transparency, and empowers people
instead of exploiting them.


If We don’t talk about it, They’ll pretend plagiarism and exploitation of workers is Fine...<br><br>
So yeah, maybe it's annoying. But staying silent?
That would be stupid as fuck.

                                                    When corporations get big enough, they’d rather say sorry after they fuck you instead of asking for permission. Insta doesn't even give people the option to opt out. 
                                                    They want you to fill out a huge form to even consider maybe taking you out of the data pool. They also require you to FIND your data in the fucken sea of slop. If you do find it...They still want you to "prove it". <br><br>

                                                    If we stay quiet they will keep trying to make this normal. It's not the first time they tried and it won't be the last.</p>

                                          Another massive issue, AI companies want to normalize taking no responsibility if you break the law using their tools.
                                                  Their plagiarism machine infringes on a copyright and got u sued?? Apparently that’s on YOU.
                                                 Meanwhile, they keep doing whatever the hell they want.
                                                Sometimes they do it on purpose, like using Studio Ghibli styles in their slop generators. They know that Hayao Miyazaki HATED Ai. Their "trend" turned everyone into their Ad! 

                                               Although It did also show us how ridiculously dumb it is to think that Ai is anything more than automated copying. Now that even babies can make Ai slop Its losing value FAST & making anyone who uses it look cheap as fuck😂<br> <br> 
                                              OpenAi doesn't care that the servers are melting. That's the only reason they got more investments. If nobody uses chatGPT then no money. If they use it too much investors get stupid happy and see dollar signs for when they finally get to flip that switch.

                                                They know exactly what they’re doing, & they know people will defend their “friend” ChatGPT. The more you see it as a friend the easier it is for them to keep taking away your rights. Even if you never make anything at all, eventually it catches up to everyone.<br><br>
                                                
                                                
                                                Aside from the tsunami of scams created to scam old people.
                                                There is also ads using your face and voice without permission, you needed lot's of data now just 1 photo. How do you think Bytedance was able to make such a realistic Ai that makes faces?? hmmm maybe ALLL THE DATA TIKTOK PROVIDED???
                                                Is it legal for them to use all your data?? Fuck no, but you can't prove it and if we normalize it then it's legal. You could end up seeing yourself promoting all kinds of things. It's already happening.
