                <h2 style="color: var(--theme) !important;">WHO IS KEVIN ROBLES </h2>
<p>
Kevin Robles AKA NEXUS‚òÖHUE  Õ°ÕôÕò‚òÖ<strong><br>
A BROWN, SECOND GENERATION, AMERICAN CITIZEN OF THE USA. <br> 
Biography, Part 1 of 2 <br>
</strong> </p>
   <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> TIJUANA X TEPIC NAYA </h4>

   <p>   My parents & I lived in Tijuana for a couple of years. From there I moved to live with my grandparents in Tepic Nayarit, where I started drawing.
I came to Fresno California when I was around 7 years old. 
In middle school I started posting videos on Facebook, just ranting & talking about shit I noticed. More classmates mentioned them to me & I got worried, because teachers at the time kept telling us that the internet would completely ruin our lives & prevent us from EVER GETTING A JOB LMAOO. 
So I just deleted EVERYTHING...
Teachers absolutely hated the Internet in the early days. Possibly because for them it really did just lead to getting fired.... so I guess I agree shit was different lol. 
During this time, I was also helping my mom with her yard sales. I would help her translate & seal deals to get a cut of the profits. Eventually, I started buying used video games, but quickly moved on to musical instruments & electronics out of curiosity. </p><br> 

  <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> HIGHSCHOOL DAYS </h4>
 <p> 	In highschool, I got really into making videos. I joined the video program, but it started to make me lose interest for videos. 
    Projects were boring as FUCK. All about recording people playing with balls or the "news on campus" which just revolved around more balls... üòí<br><br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Rubrics vs eating ass </h5>
	<p> I went to CART for video production, but it only pushed me away from video even more. 
     That program was full of favoritism, and ass eating. Being the teacher‚Äôs pets was practically a requirement. 
 They gave us a rubric but following it was not enough for them, they also required blind obedience. 
 English teacher kept saying ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt feel like you deserve it‚Äù which is stupid as shit. The rubric is based on facts not feelings. 
 The video teacher also got upset that I didn't ask him for his input on the final iteration of the video after he had approved the concept.
 He literally said "you didn't wanna ask me for help >;[ "
  He wasn't mad that I made a mistake, just mad he didn't get to contribute to each iteration. 
      But how was I supposed too know this foo was a micromanager that would take it out on my grades???<br> 
     
       So I left that stupid ass circus. 
      Those teachers started turning my team against me after that. Telling the team they would all fail & it was all "KEVIN's FAULT FOR LEAVING"
      I offered to help make the videos even tho I don't even get credit, but this only made the teachers MORE ANGRY. 
      At this point, they started using double-speak in front of me. Bullshit like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all too common for teams to fall apart because of pretentious individuals who leave their team, but those SELFISH INDIVIDUALS, they get what's coming to them. 
They don‚Äôt make it very far. They eventually get blacklisted and don't make it in the industry‚Äùüëπ </p><br>
    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> FRESNO'S BEAT </h5>
 <P>Ever wonder why Fresno & Clovis have such a huge problem with ‚ÄúDUH-DUH-DUH, BRAIN-DRAIN, BRAIN-DRAIN, DUH-DUH-DUH, BRAIN-DRAIN‚Äù
 It‚Äôs because this shithole always locks out the people who don‚Äôt wanna be eating the shit trickling down from the top of the pyramid. 
 So the only option left is to forget about the idiots getting high off their own farts & leave.</p> <br>


  <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> MY FIRST BUSINESS </h4>
    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;">  A Bet on Myself </h5>
<p> After leaving those programs, I picked up skateboarding. The freedom of it all got me back into making videos for fun again. I started taking the failed clips to make funny edits for social media. 
    Also kept breaking my phone while skating, so I learned to fix it. 
I thought I could fix phones as a service, but nobody would trust me to work on their phone. So I took a chance buying a broken one & fixed it. <br><br>

 <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Flipping iPhones & middle fingers </h5>
<P>I flipped a couple phones, then specialized on flipping iphones to stock up on inventory. 
While working on this, I came across scammers selling fake, broken, or stolen phones. Instead of quitting, I turned that shit into a new opportunity. 
I learned to fix more parts, looked for more flaws & offered lower prices according to the damage of the phone.
I also learned to factory unlock em & tell apart the fake ones from the real ones. (foreshadowing?üëÄ)<br>
I can fix a blacklisted phone and made them BETTER fully unlocking them, no more issues, just more features, but a fake phone isn‚Äôt worth SHIT TO ANYONE. </p><br> 

  <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;">DAYS of UNI TO CITY  </h4>
 <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Fresno State </h5>
	<p>After highschool I moved out & went to Fresno State. I was undeclared & super tired of working while in school, so I took a break and started working full time.
    While working in a fruit packing factory, I had a neck injury that made me reconsider my options.</p> <br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Radiology </h5>
	<p>I went to Fresno City because I still wasn't sure what I wanted to be.
    At first, I went into radiology hoping to help other injured people. 
    Radiology classes were boring as fuck tho. I needed something that wouldn't put me to sleep but still seen as ‚Äúa real job‚Äù.</p> <br>
    
        <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Auto Mechanic as a Career ! </h5>
   	<p> 		I decided to use my experience keeping my piece of shit car on the road as my starting point for my career. 

    	I had already fixed things on my car, people's cars at work, and family. Things like fuel pumps, head gaskets, dealing with tons off electrical issues due to water damage, & cooling system leaks or issues people had with starting up the cars.
    I even made some parts out of scraps. Like the starter engine & AC compressor were both made out of broken parts I combined with scraps from the junkyard. 
    Sometimes neither the junkyard part nor my own worked, but together they could make up for the worn out pieces. 
    That car was falling apart, the past owner even had coins in place of fuses lmaoo. 

Shit was a coffin on wheels, I just kept bringing back from the dead, mostly out of necessity, but sometimes it was actually fun. 
Like the time my heater core broke & couldn‚Äôt find one at the junkyard. Retail cost was more than the whole fucken car, so I bypassed it & closed off the circuit until I could find the part used. 
Just added less coolant to accommodate for the missing piece. Looking for parts at the junkyard was kinda fun, it was like being in a Star Wars looking ass planet trynna find parts to fix the ship & get off a dusty planet lol </p> <br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Mechanic as a Career ??? </h5>
	  	<p>I felt like I was in the right place in automotive classes! 
    I didn‚Äôt have the same experience as the people who already had a job and just went back for the degree, but I was super excited to learn more! The teachers in that department were very supportive, which is not common in my experience with teachers.
     In the end, I decided not to continue working in automotive because even tho It was fun.
    I felt like that environment was going to be an issue for me as I get older. 
    At the time, my neck injury was only getting worse, I kept getting hurt doing the simplest of things. So I got super depressed for a long time....  <br> <br>

          <p><strong>KEVIN ROBLES AKA NEXUS‚òÖHUE  Õ°ÕôÕò‚òÖ PART 2 </strong></p>

          <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> CITY DAYS, FINDING ART AGAIN </h4>
    <p>I started skating around campus to get to class & took photography as an elective then switched to graphic communications. (not because the photo class was good, it was actually super boring & restricted but I no longer cared about the grades just interested in the art lol) 
    Graphic communications made me take intro classes in things like video editing, graphic design, Photoshop, social media marketing, web design etc. <br><br>

            <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Back to creative fields </h5>
   <p> While at Fresno City, I saw a lot of my previous experiences with teachers. 
    One teacher kept telling me that I CANNOT be a ‚Äúmultimedia‚Äù artist. That's ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù, but in reality, it was just her projecting. 
    How are u gonna tell me it‚Äôs not possible when I‚Äôve already been doing it since before I even met you?? 
    In her defense, pretty much all teachers tell me stuff like this BEFORE they see my work. 
    (not saying my work is amazing, but most people assume I suck ass until they actually see my work. Especially teachers) </p><br>

      <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Photo editing </h5>
  <p>	The Photo editing professor was very supportive at first. According to him, I was color grading images ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù. 
    However, once I started bringing in my Photo editing skills especially for creative uses, he started accusing me of stealing work....
     It got to the point where I just turned in EVERY SINGLE PROJECT with the proof attached before he even asked. All files embedded. That way, I could just point to it instead of scrambling to prove I deserve my grade & not expulsion. <br><br>
     
     
    Never apologized directly, but did apologize to the class. However, and I‚Äôm sorry to everyone in that class, that ‚Äúapology‚Äù was stupid as fuck. 
     All of our work was public on the discussion boards. I was the only one going off track from those step by step tutorials... aside from other people who did copy from literally the first page of google images. So I'll admit it's not that crazy to assume the whole class was stealing shit lmaooo.
  But dude really addressed the whole class ‚ÄúI am deeply sorry I made assumptions about the students at Fresno City, but now I see that there are a lot of talented students in Fresno City‚Äù wtf?? xD<br><br>

      <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Graphic design @city</h5>
<p>	The president chair for graphic design at the time I was there started out the exact opposite. He started out very critical of all my work. 
    Half the class had failed from the last semester, so I was confused why he was so harsh on me & so damn supportive to people who literally failed his class multiple times. (Some of them more than TWICE btw‚Ä¶.) 
    People who failed got too much help in my opinion. Holding your hand like a baby type shit... for grown adults in their 30s & up....<br>

 My classmates started out being supportive & pointed out the teacher was being too harsh on my work. 
 Once I started getting the hang of Adobe Illustrator, they switched teams for some reason. 
    All of a sudden I found myself getting praise from the teacher & alienation from classmates. 
    During finals, I wanted to do the main illustration for a group project but was told by someone who already worked in design that 
    ‚Äúthis stuff is a lot more difficult than you think it is, I know how difficult it REALLY IS.‚Äù  
    I agreed he could make the illustration, and I would do the boring ass nutrition label. I still added my illustration on my version because we had to make one personal version each and one collaborative version for the group. 
    The group illustration came out like shit dude, even the teacher bluntly asked why we didn't just use mine instead of his LMAOoO0o. Towards the end, classmates no longer supported my efforts at all, but the teacher was a lot more supportive. 
    On the last day, he told us how he was going to retire. Said he was interested in working with me if I ever started a business. I didn‚Äôt say anything, just nodded and smiled, but if you are reading this now, i'm sorry but it was a no then and it‚Äôs still a no right now.
    It‚Äôs not personal, you‚Äôre just too bossy & I don't bring enough value. I'd probably just get bossed around in exchange for "connections"</p><br>


  <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> NEXUS‚òÖHUE LAUNCH!  </h4>

<h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Introductions </h5>
    <p> My intro class on business helped me decide to take a chance and start my own. 
    The professor, Amber Balakian, was one of the first people to outright say they believed my services could turn into a business. 
    At the time, I was just trying to sell my video services. She connected me with a local ad agency that she used, as well as Bitwise & an entrepreneur mentoring program. 
    None of those helped me. If anything it was quite the opposite, but I wouldn't say that's on her.</p> <br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Mr. Important & Fresno's Delusional Obsession w/ Criminals</h5>
	<p>I met the mutual connection,  an employee at Bitwise. This person was supposed to introduce me to Jake.
    (CEO of Bitwise, currently in jail for a ponzi scheme) When I met him, he told me,
    ‚ÄúMr Jake is a very VERY important person, and your tone doesn‚Äôt sound like you know what you‚Äôre talking about. 
    I can‚Äôt be wasting Mr. Soberal‚Äôs time.‚Äù 
    Idk why this motherfucker couldn't just listen to the words used instead of reading the tone like he's some wild animal running on primal instinct.
     If you can‚Äôt understand English just tone, then it's no wonder Fresno keeps getting scammed by criminals in a blazer. You've got dumbasses like this at the top of the pyramid making all the wrong decisions ü§£ </p> <br>

   
<h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Not a Partner, Just your Plug </h5>
   <p> I asked if they wanted to collab, and they all ignored my message. One employee did respond saying they are "always looking for employees‚Ä¶". I felt like this wasn‚Äôt just rude, it was straight up stupid because that‚Äôs not what I asked & they even stated to reach out for collabs on their website. 
    I still went along and answered his questions about the software I use. I didn‚Äôt hear back from them. However, months later, they tried to reach out for 3d type shit. (I noticed they now had an in house 3d guy using some of the same software as me....so why reach out eh??ü§† lmao)
   They wanted me to do the 3d scenes and then hand it back to them to deliver the final product. 
    This would make it seem like they made everything, and I‚Äôm just an employee behind the scenes. Why would I do that? why should I even consider helping them??</p><br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Mentorship or Meat Market? </h5>
	<p>The mentorship program, I‚Äôm low-key still trynna figuring out. I don‚Äôt think the owners are full blown evil, or maybe I don‚Äôt wanna believe it. 
        They might even be drinking their own koolaid and they don't see it as wrong somehow.
        Program claims to help entrepreneurs with their businesses. However, looking at the facts and not their curated marketing. (Although even their own marketing kinda snitches them out lol) 
    It looks more like a front to find competent employees for their rich friends.... <br> <br>

    They have been quoted saying things that contradict the mission. Things like, ‚Äúpeople that possess an entrepreneurial mindset are really NEEDED IN CORPORATIONS of all sizes to HELP THEM prosper and achieve success‚Äù  WTF?? This is ALL ABOUT CORPORATE not trynna help entrepreneurs, just clearly stating they wanna use them... 
    Another suspicious quote is "four of his former  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà who  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà hired after they completed the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà program....students involved in business and entrepreneurship are often better equipped for the working world."In a business like this you want entrepreneurial people ‚Äì risk takers, 
    people who take an initiative, people with good values and solid ethics,‚Äù  ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a terrific program.""

   They clearly state that the goal is to help themselves or CORPORATIONS.
    Good values and ethics are only prioritized to exploit good people...of course they think it's a great program.
    They just finished talking about how it constantly keeps giving them great employees. These are people who normally would not have crossed paths if this place stated their real mission clearly.<br><br>


    My stupid ass only realized this after the fall of Bitwise. <br> 
    Now it makes sense why all the people in the program were just employees for different ‚Äúmentors‚Äù... 
    It also makes sense why the mentors all kept suggesting jobs instead of helping anyone with anything.
    
    The careers suggested directly aligned with their own interests. If your mentor is in real estate, and they keep telling you to go to college for real estate license so you can work for them...That's not insider info, that‚Äôs 10000% PURE MANIPULATION OF NAIVE STUDENTS. 
    Especially when the ‚Äúguidance‚Äù exclusively benefits their own business time and time again.</p> <br>

 <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;">BIT UNWISE PONZI SCHEME</h4>
   
   <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Introductions (to a Scam) </h5>
<p>	That mentoring organization paired me with one of the founders of the Bitwise Ponzi scheme. 
    This founder told us he always researches the people he meets with. So I researched him & assumed he would to. He acted like he had never seen my work but slipped up once he got comfortable. 
    Letting me know he was looking at my work the night before on instagram even tho he had just finished saying "I have an insta but I NEVER use that thing :] ". </p><br>

       <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> The Art of Slipping on your own ice</h5>
 <p>	On the second meeting he brought along 2 girls from the program because 3 heads are better than one right?
  He forgot I was present & started scheming against me right in front of me! The funniest part is HE ADMITTED TO IT AFTER I STARTED LAUGHING MY ASS OFF "You weren't supposed to hear that part" he says.... 
  LMAOOO bro u just expect me to just delete the file from my head? I'm not a fucken pc or an etch a sketch, this situation had me dying from laughter! </p>  <br>
    
  <p> I mention this to the mentoring program & got gaslit so I just went ahead with yet another meeting...
  This founder gave me a tour of Bitwise‚Äôs empty ass buildings & introduced me to their in house plants. (The program taught us how to use plants so no shit I'm gonna be looking for them lol) 
    One of those house plants was his son, whom he had spent the past 15 minutes hyping up with stories of his upbringing & how he had been "preparing him for this role".  

    The final boss of Nepo babies. The CEO of Bitwise. My "mentor", also gave me his own origin story, which made it all come together even better...

       According to him, he said AND I QUOTE ‚ÄúI was a criminal, but I was a smart criminal! :D‚Äù and then proceeded to tell me the story of the stupidest heist in history. 
    (Publicly available story by the way, he bragged about it quite a lot for some reason. There's multiple temu ass "ted talks" where he used this story..)

His great "heist" was stealing books from...his own school...then selling them...back to the students in the parking lot....(I wasn't expecting much but holy shit this was just sad xD)
 Leave it to a narcissist to flip that shit into ‚Äú I had all the supply & those who control supply control the flow of money hehehe ;D‚Äù 
    I mean it makes sense why Bitwise was so obsessed with monopolies, but dude‚Äôs obviously a certified idiot‚Ä¶.He committed a crime & in his mind, he was ‚Äúa businessman‚Äù. 
    Okay, iguess to his credit, lot's of "businessmen" really are just criminals in a blazer, but that‚Äôs like saying all whales are killer whales lmaoo</p><br>

 <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> When Gaslighting Just doesn't cut it Anymore </h5>
<p> This founder then tried to indirectly threatened me to either join Bitwise or get blacklisted... 
    First he started off with a soft push. Having one of the girls get the ball rolling by asking the questions he wanted for his script. 
One side eye to one of the girls and she started reciting her script right away! She said "and so if somebody wants to join Bitwise, how would they do it!?:D Do you reach out to them or do they have to ask you?;D"
His response "EVERYONE wants to join bitwise, we DO NOT go chasing after ANYONE so anyone thinking of joining needs to ask"<br><br>
Then they both look at me & we sit in silence for a cool minute as I nod like a lobotomized kermit. Making them think I did not understand shit,because I didn't wanna disagree openly & get blacklisted right away....
That's when he decided to have us all go for a little trip in the car & started to indirectly threatened me to either join Bitwise or get blacklisted...   <br><br>

    He used an example of someone else whom he was currently blacklisting in Fresno, using his monopoly pod. 
    (once the ponzi scheme was public I found out this was common practice with them, even if you joined them and they got to own your company.
    You still get screwed over)
    Then tried to make me understand with his story about his time in the Marines. 
    The story was about him getting his ass kicked, and even spelled out the moral of the story for me cuz he thought I was stupid as shit lmao. In his defense, I do love to play it up a lot sometimes. Maybe it's strategy, May be for fun? Or maybe it's Maybellene...  
    Anyway, He stated that when everyone is against you, you need to understand you can't win and get in line. SOooo, more monopoly nepo baby type shit in Fresno, who could have guessed huh? 
    When I tried to tell the program about this, EVERYONE started gaslighting me and scheming to get their story straight against me. <br><br>
    
    Shortly after that...Bitwise fell and took with it any kind of pride these people had for that scam. 
    Yet some people still act like we shouldn‚Äôt talk about this. Like they are either tied up in something bigger or just too fucken stupid to see reality.  
    Even people who got directly scammed by Bitwise say ‚Äúnooo this is ruining fresno! We will never recover! pls stop talking about the bad nooeee, fReSnO WiLL nEvEr rEcoVeR‚Äù 
    IF you think like this, then I‚Äôm sorry because you obviously don‚Äôt know any better but you are a fucken moron. 
    THIS IS THE EXACT FUCKEN REASON WHY IT KEEPS HAPPENING. PEOPLE FORGET & REPEAT THAT SHIT. There is still a ton of pyramids in the valley!
    If we act like this is nothing, then other pyramids will keep recycling the same bullshit every couple of years without any issues. DON'T BE FUCKEN STUPID FRESNO! </p> <br> 


 <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;">A TODDLER'S GAME</h4>
    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> Introductions </h5>
    <p>After the bitwise scam, the program introduced me to a children's game designer that turned out to be‚Ä¶ another scam‚Ä¶. I mean at this point, this feels like my fault for staying. The owner of this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù told me he needed a fundraising video for Kickstarter. 
    This was my first time selling one of my ads, so I gave him a very competitive price. I felt bad that the money raised from donations might not cover the cost of the video. 
    (even tho that‚Äôs literally not my fucken job but I felt bad about it either way because I wanted to help) <br><br>
    
    Then I found out he left ALL THE KEY DETAILS OUT... 
    He tried to position lying to me as ‚Äúan opportunity‚Äù even tho he just took my ad and used it for undisclosed use cases. THAT'S ILLEGAL AS FUCK!</p> <br>

        <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> The real goals </h5>    
     <p> In retrospective, that whole shit was shady from the start...
    He kept obsessively trying to force himself into my work process, I kept telling him I don't need his help. 
    He wanted me to make the video in his office space & seemed like he was trynna make me an employee without benefits.  

    His ‚Äúhelp‚Äù would only slow me down, teaching him everything only benefits him lmao. 
        He also kept repeating how I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna work for big corporations because they pay well but they are difficult to work with,‚Äù then used the worst examples to back up his claims because the issues mentioned were all present with him while getting paid in peanuts....
    In reality, he made a really strong case for going corporate and forgetting about him altogether.</p> <br>

    <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> New "mentor" enters the chat... </h5>  
    <p> He started coming into the program, giving ‚Äúclasses‚Äù where he was just trying to brainwash me into giving him more free shit. 
    Using himself as an example how he sends buyers extra game pieces if they ask, and said "if you sell something that doesn't even cost you money, then it should be that much easier right :D "
    (Saying this while looking directly at me to imply I better do this when he asks for free shit since I make things myself instead of buying it like a stupid ass Nepo baby.) 
    Just as predicted, he did add more stuff that he had just casually left out after I finished the video. 
    
    I did revisions as many times as necessary to make sure the final product was something he liked.
    After I handed the video to him, he still proceeded to mutilate my video by breaking the timing, pacing, and adding new visuals on top to pretend like he contributed. 
    Then posted it on Linkedin and did credit me at the end of a giant paragraph but kept giving advice to people on Linkedin about how he "does his own VFX" wtf VFX have you ever done???
    (Changing my work is against copyright law, I don't even need a contract stating that. This is just wrong & the implications of him having "helped" with the vfx grossed me out) 
    He also took out all references that clearly stated this video was made specifically for a Kickstarter campaign... </p> <br>
    
         <h5 style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> The irony is strong with this one </h5>   
    <p>Then came the most ironic and literally brain-dead part of the whole story involving him. 
    RIGHT AFTER he disclosed that he was gonna take my video & sell his game to a corporation in London, he started pretending like this was a huge opportunity for me.
     He asks me what it is I need to take my business to ‚Äúthe next level‚Äù. 
    I said I just need to save up more money. He got visibly upset and said, ‚ÄúKevin IT‚ÄôS NOT ALL ABOUT THE MONEYYY! It‚Äôs about community and helping your friends! :D‚Äù 
    (This is the same shit my last "mentor" kept saying. That I was too obsessed with money & fame. Idk wtf even makes them arrive at that conclusion. Sounds more like projections to me.)<br><br>

    At this point I swear I wasn‚Äôt even sure anymore if he was just extremely stupid or if he thought I was the stupid one. 
    How is he gonna tell me this bullshit right after I LITERALLY MADE HIM A VIDEO HE WILL USE TO GO BEG FOR MONEY ON KICKSTARTER?? & THEN HIDES THE FACT HE WILL ALSO USE IT TO GO BEG FOR EVEN MORE MONEY IN LONDON?????????<br><br>



     <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> NEXUS‚òÖHUE's Voice</h4>
<p>After this bullshit, I decided to start looking for connections & clients elsewhere to avoid the tsunami of scammers in Fresno. That‚Äôs when I realized those fuckers are EVERYWHERE...
I‚Äôve met too many people in pyramid schemes , or ponzi schemes, and to be completely honest with you. I don‚Äôt think they even know wtf a ponzi scheme is or maybe most don‚Äôt give a shit as long as it pays something. 

Most people I ask say, ‚Äúnoo no dude it really does pay :D‚Äù. 
When people truly believe in a pyramid, they will only see you as the enemy. They'll remain dazed & confused when the house of cards falls over. ‚ÄúIgUeSs wE‚Äôll neVer knOw wHy BitWiSe FeLL‚Äù<br> <br>

Most people in Fresno/Clovis give me ‚Äúadvice‚Äù that they would NOT follow themselves. Even if I ask them to their face right after they suggested it, they agree they would not do that themselves. SOoo‚Ä¶..
 Wtf is that then?? Just shitty advice or more fucken scammers pretending to be allies??</p> <br>


   <h4 class="yaytext-style" style="color: var(--theme) !important;"> NEXUS‚òÖHUE MISSION</h4>
<p> I know that just like me. There has to be more businesses out there that are being held back by their ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù. 
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong. I'm not trynna be ‚Äúthe good guy‚Äù or some stupid shit like that. I'm trynna help talented businesses that are overlooked because I know we can make some serious waves. It's just good business to work with competent people.
If I ever feel bad for anyone, I'm technically just helping myself. <br> <br>


I‚Äôm sick & tired of all the nepotism, gate keeping, Red tape, and useless middlemen in the industry pulling the strings while being oblivious to the facts. 
If you‚Äôre also tired of the bullshit, let‚Äôs work together! 
Together, we can leave these talentless hacks in the dust. Their yes men chains keep them buying trash at scale, let them huff their own farts in their echo chambers of hype. 
In times like these, money runs dry & that‚Äôs when innovators rise.</p>
